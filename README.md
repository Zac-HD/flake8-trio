# flake8-trio

A highly opinionated flake8 plugin for Trio-related problems.

This can include anything from outright bugs, to pointless/dead code,
to likely performance issues, to minor points of idiom that might signal
a misunderstanding.

It may well be too noisy for anyone with different opinions, that's OK.

Pairs well with flake8-async and flake8-bugbear.

## Installation

pip install flake8-trio
